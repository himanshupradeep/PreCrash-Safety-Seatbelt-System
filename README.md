#  Precrash Seatbelt System â€“ CANoe Project

This project demonstrates the simulation of an intelligent **Precrash Seatbelt System** in a CANoe environment, showcasing how sensor-driven crash detection triggers automated seatbelt pretensioning to enhance occupant safety and reduce injury risks before a collision occurs.

##  Functional Overview
![ScreenRecording2025-06-22093242-ezgif com-video-to-gif-converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f11919e-76aa-4553-a927-80f8fab4388d)


### 1. Detection of Impending Crash
The system monitors a range of vehicle dynamics using:
- Radar Sensors
- Camera Systems
- Lidar
- ESC & ABS feedback
- Accelerometers

These sensors detect sudden decelerations and hazardous scenarios ahead of time.

### 2. Activation of Seatbelt Pretensioner
When an emergency situation is judged, the ECU engages a motorized pretensioner, retracting the shoulder belt to provide both protection and a sense of security.

### 3. Passenger Positioning & Load Adjustment
The system subtly adjusts belt tension for optimal occupant posture and airbag compatibility.

- Enhanced passenger protection
- Reduced airbag-related injuries
- Works across multiple emergency types
- Provides maximum restraint before crash onset

##  Limitations
- High component and integration cost
- Potential for false activations
- System complexity and calibration needs
- Sensor-dependent performance

###  Activation Conditions
- Emergency braking detected
- No operation prohibition state active

###  Operation Prohibition Conditions
- Seatbelt is unfastened
- Vehicle speed â‰¤ 15 km/h
- Pretensioner triggered 3 times successively (requires ~7-minute cooldown)
- Fail-safe state triggered

---

##  CAN Signals

- `Seatbelt_Lock_Signal`  - whether the seatbelt is latched or unlatched
- `Seatbelt_Rotation_Signal` - detects the rotational movement of the seatbelt spool or retractor mechanism
- `Brake_Pedal_Signal` â€“ varies with stroke
- `Accelerator_Signal` â€“ represents throttle input

Includes CANoe configuration files for Precrash ECU and Tester ECU to emulate real-time CAN communication. Enables simulation of crash detection logic and seatbelt actuation flow.

### 2. Database Creation

Contains the `.dbc` file defining CAN signals and message structures. Ensures consistent interpretation of data across all simulation nodes and tools.

### 3. Panel Design

Custom visual interface for real-time monitoring and control. Displays ECU activity, sensor input status, and seatbelt operation indicators.

### 4. CAPL Scripting
![Screenshot 2025-06-22 093815](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d9db0c0-742a-4630-887d-394a273c53f5)

Automation logic implemented in CAPL to simulate sensor behavior, activate diagnostics, and control seatbelt mechanisms. Scripts validate system performance under various test scenarios.

##  Diagnostic System Design

### Precrash ECU
1. Listens to CAN messages continuously  
2. On threshold brake input: fastens belt within 0.5 seconds  
3. On accelerator = 0: releases belt  

### Tester ECU
1. Periodically sends CAN messages  
2. Sends MSB = 15 signal to simulate brake input  
3. Verifies lock signal from Precrash ECU  
4. Sends acceleration message  
5. Confirms belt reset condition  



---

##  Test Scenarios

1. System detects valid brake signal voltage  
2. Seatbelt locks within 0.5 seconds  
3. Release occurs when acceleration = 0  
4. Validates ECU response over CAN
